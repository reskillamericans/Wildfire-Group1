# Wildfire App

Welcome!

- To begin, you would need to create a fork of the repository `https://github.com/reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group1.git`
- You can then clone the forked repository on your local computer.
- Each feature you work on will be done in a separate branch. Each new branc should be named by the feature being worked on. You can use namings like "feature/newsLetter".
  To create a new branch, run `git checkout -b branch_name` (where branch_name is the name of the new branch being created.)

### Staying Updated
When working with many people on the same codebase, sometimes others make changes that affect your work. While great care has been taken to create a modular team workflow to keep this to a minimum, merge conflicts are inevitable. It would not be nice to finish working on a task or feature, only to find that the codebase has evolved and you need to rework everything to conform to the new changes. This is managed in two ways.       
__*First*__, make sure your understand the folder structure and stick to it.      
__*Second*__, each team member needs to make sure that at every given time, their working directory is up-to-date with the latest changes from the upstream *development* branch. This is achieved with a two-fold process.       
#### Pulling Upstream
After setting up your fork on github and cloning it locally on your system, you'll need to run a command just once to create a connection between your local repository and the remote upstream repository. Note that there's automatically a remote 'origin' repository set up when you clone. This points to your fork. Now you need to set up 'upstream' which will point to the central upstream repo.

- Open a terminal and go into the directory for the newly cloned repo. Now add the upstream remote like so:        
    <pre>git remote add upstream https://github.com/reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group1.git</pre>
PS: *You may get an error saying the `upstream` remote has already been configured. If so, then you are good to go.*   

Now you're all set up.       
__*The following steps must be run periodically to keep your work up-to-date! You can run these commands as often as possible. You want to fetch any new changes as soon as possible. Each time you want to begin working, or take a break from your work, run these first.*__     
Be sure to  commit all local changes first. 

1. Switch to the development branch        
    <pre>git checkout development</pre>     
2. Get all remote upstream changes into your local computer.        
    <pre>git fetch upstream</pre>     
3. Merge changes fetched with your local development branch. ('development' must be the currently checked-out branch)       
    <pre>git merge upstream/development</pre>    
4. Push the newly merged changes to your fork's remote (online) repo. This is configured as 'origin' by default.    
    <pre>git push origin development</pre>      

If you've created a new branch to work on rather than working directly on `development`, then run the next steps.

5. Switch to your feature branch.        
    <pre>git checkout your-feature-branch</pre>        
6. Merge the changes on the newly merged development branch, into your feature branch.        
    <pre>git merge development</pre>
    *You may encounter merge conflicts here.
    [Resolve them](https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line),
    then come back and complete the merge. If you merge often enough, any conflicts would be trivial and very few.*

7. Finally, push your newly merged feature branch to the remote github server for backup.
    <pre>git push origin your-feature-branch</pre>   


##### Pull Requests
Once you are done working on your feature, you may go on to https://github.com/reskillamericans/Wildfire-Group1.git to create apull request between your fork and the project repo.


*The git procedures may look like a lot at first glance. It's okay. You've still got this. You will get a hang of it in no time*

  ## Running the server

- Don't forget to 'npm install' after cloning the project!
- Make sure to have a .env file with the information in the *.env.example* file. If at any point, your feature requires you to add a new env variable, be sure to include it in *.env.example* so that others can see and use it too

- Command lines to start the server
  - To start server in development mode: 'npm run dev'
  - To start server in production mode: 'npm run start'
  - To delete faqs "npm run deleteFaqs"

## Send Email Function
1. Require sendEmail from the services folder 
2. sendEmail is an async function that will take in an object of options. The options are (email, subject, message)
3. Don't forget to add the mailtrap.io credentials to your .env file. An example can be seen in the .env.example file. 

### Example
```javascript
//Email message
    const message =
      'Thank you for joining us! We promise to only send emails that are important to you regarding any new updates or features added to the application!';

    //Send email to newly created subscriber
    await sendEmail({
      email: req.body.email,
      subject: 'Welcome to the Wildfire Subscription!',
      message,
    });
```

All the best!
